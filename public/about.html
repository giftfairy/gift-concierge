    <h1>About Gift Lane</h1>
    <p>
      Gift Lane is your calm, luxe-feeling gifting concierge. It’s for people who
      don’t have time to scroll endless product pages, but still care deeply about
      giving something that feels personal and intentional.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      You tell Gift Lane who the gift is for, what you’re celebrating, and your
      budget. Behind the scenes, an AI assistant curates ideas that are thoughtful,
      realistic, and aligned with Aussie brands, shipping, and budgets.
    </p>

    <h2>Why it exists</h2>
    <p>
      Gift Lane was created by a very tired mum who was sick of last-minute panic
      buys, generic hampers, and analysis paralysis. The goal is simple: make
      gifting feel easy again, without losing the heart behind it.
