    <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
    <p>
      Some of the links shared on Gift Lane may be affiliate links. This means
      that if you click a link and make a purchase, Gift Lane may earn a small
      commission from the retailer – at no extra cost to you.
    </p>

    <h2>What this means in normal-people language</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You pay exactly the same price you would if you went direct.</li>
      <li>The small commission helps keep Gift Lane online and improving.</li>
      <li>Suggestions are based on fit for the person and occasion – not just commission.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Partners may include major retailers, small Australian businesses, and
      affiliate networks such as Awin, Commission Factory or Impact (once
      approved). As the site grows, this list may change over time.
